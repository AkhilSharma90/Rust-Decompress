This is the 2nd project in the 50 Rust projects playlist on my channel.
In the first project, we compressed a file using the flate2 package.
But in this project, instead of using the flate2 (which would have been too easy),
we're relying on the regular old "zip" in Rust, so that you can explore some more aspects
of Rust.

Don't forget to leave a star in case you benefit from this code :)
